# SIRD-Epidemiological-Model-with-Euler-s-Method
SIRD Epidemiological Model with Euler's Method This repository explores and implements the SIRD epidemiological model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased) to simulate disease spread in a population. The model is based on a system of differential equations that describe the dynamics of infection, recovery, and mortality rates.
